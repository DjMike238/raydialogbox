# RayDialogue

Simple dialogue system POC made with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) and [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go).

The blip sounds are made with [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/), you can find the sample files in the [bfxr](https://github.com/DjMike238/raydialogbox/tree/master/bfxr) folder.

This might be the messiest and shittiest code I've ever written... but it works, somehow.
